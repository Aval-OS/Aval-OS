# Aval-OS
Main repository for the Aval Operating System, a security focused microkernel architecture OS for the future.

Inspired by:
- SEL4 & Redox kernel architecture
- GrapheneOS's Hardened_Malloc, Verified Boot, & Attestation

Aval OS is designed to be virtualized by a seL4 Native Hypervisor, and be built primarily in Rust with libseL4-rs
